    "Python is a programming language that has been growing in popularity in recent years. There are many reasons for this, but it mostly comes down to Python being easy to learn and use as well as the fact that Python has a very active community that develops amazing extensions to Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become one of the most frequently used languages in the world of data science due to the ability to almost instantly apply it to a large number of data science problems. When asking companies in different industries and of various sizes what lanuage they would like their data scientists to know when coming in, they almost all agree that Python is the best choice. "

    "\n",
    "IPython Notebooks (with an I, there is no such thing as a Python notebook) is what we are looking at right now. It is a web browser based way of writing Python code. One of the benefits is that it allows you to write in plain text to create, what should feel like, a notebook. The closest analog here would be to relate an IPython notebook to a typical lab notebook kept by \"traditional\" researchers. Anyone coming from chemistry or biology will probably understand what I mean.\n",
    "We will be using IPython notebooks for the rest of the semester. A majority of your class notes will be presented in this format. This will allow us to both have a place for discussion and instruction, but with the added benefit of allowing us to play with data live! \n",
